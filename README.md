# Reflection 

On December 17th, we had the opportunity to visit the data center at UTMDigital.

Our day began with a presentation in one of the building's halls, where we learned about the services offered by UTMDigital and received contact information for any wifi or technical support needs. Additionally, we gained insight into the infrastructure of the UTM Data Centre. A speaker then discussed the development process of the UTMSmart application. Finally, a UTM graduate shared his experiences from his time at university and his subsequent career, including stories about working as part of a programming team.

After the presentations, we took a guided tour of the facility. Our first stop was the UTM DigitalCare office, where we explored various rooms and had a brief overview of the office setup. We saw a conference room that featured a smartboard utilized for virtual meetings, and two technicians explained the workings of UTM DigitalCare.

Next, we moved to the main office at UTMDigital, where a speaker talked about the open office concept employed in the workspace. Before concluding our visit, we had the chance to interview one of the programmers. He shared insights about his experiences working at UTMDigital and offered advice for students like us.

I'm glad I could participate in this industry visit. It gave me a valuable insight into the operations of UTMDigital and helped me understand an essential department at UTM that supports students with their technological concerns.
